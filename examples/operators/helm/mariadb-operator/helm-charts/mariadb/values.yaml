# This service account name should match what is defined in `deploy/service_account.yaml` or `ClusterServiceVersion.yaml` when using OLM/OperatorHub

resources: {}
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
