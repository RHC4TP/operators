== Ansible Operator Quickstart Guide

This guide will walk through using the operator-sdk to create an example operator using Ansible.
To complete this tutorial you will need the following items installed or accessible:

* Operator SDK, which requires recent versions of:
** git
** docker
** golang
** dep
** ansible
** ansible-runner
** ansible-runner-http
* An available Kubernetes cluster such as:
** OpenShift
** okd
** minishift
* cluster-admin permissions for your k8s user account
* quay.io or some other public container registry account

This walkthrough uses memcached (which has come to be the "Hello World" example of the Operator SDK) as the basis for an Ansible Operator. 

To begin, we'll create a new project using the `operator-sdk` cli:

 $ operator-sdk new memcached-operator --api-version=cache.example.com/v1alpha1 --kind=Memcached --type=ansible

This will create a project directory in a folder named `memcached-operator` in the current directory.
Note that we set the GVK (Group, Version, Kind) of the operator as well using the `--api-version` and `--kind` flags.
The project layout is as follows:

|===
|Files/Folders |Purpose

|deploy/
|Contains a generic set of kubernetes manifests for deploying this operator on a kubernetes cluster.

|roles/
|Contains an Ansible Role initialized using Ansible Galaxy

|build/
|Contains scripts that the operator-sdk uses for build and initialization.

|watches.yaml
|Contains Group, Version, Kind, and Ansible invocation method.
|===

Change into the `memcached-operator` directory:

 $ cd memcached-operator

NOTE: In this example we will be creating a namespace-scoped operator, meaning that the operator will monitor and manage resources within a certain namespace.
This approach is generally more flexible than creating a cluster-scoped operator, although there are applicable use cases where it may not be.


=== Watches.yaml File Overview

The `watches.yaml` file is where the GVK (Group, Version, Kind) matching a particular Custom Resource gets mapped to a specific Ansible playbook or role.
The Ansible Operator will look for the file in `/opt/ansible/watches.yaml`, and the file's schema is outlined below:

* *group* - The Custom Resource group being watched (the part _before_ the `/`, eg: *app.example.com*/v1alpha1)
* *version* - The Custom Resource version being watched (the part _after_ the `/`, eg: app.example.com/*v1alpha1*)
* *kind* - The Custom Resource kind being watched (eg: Memcached)
* *role* (default) - The path to the role that was added to the container. (eg: `/opt/ansible/roles/busybox`)
* *playbook* - The path to the playbook that was added to the container, intended as a means of calling roles.
* *reconcilePeriod* (optional) - The interval between reconciliation loop execution, affecting how often the role or playbook gets run.
* *manageStatus* (optional) - If set to true (the default), then the operator will manage the Custom Resource's status field.
If set to false, the status field is managed via role or playbook, or by a different controller.

NOTE: The `role` and `playbook` fields in `watches.yaml` are mutually exclusive, meaning you can define either but not both.

Watches.yaml file example:

----
---
# Maps a CR kind named App to a role named App
- version: v1alpha1
  group: app.example.com
  role: /opt/ansible/roles/App

# Maps a CR kind named Backend to a playbook
- version: v1alpha1
  group: backend.example.com
  kind: Backend
  playbook: /opt/ansible/playbook.yml

# Disable the reconciliation loop (run playbook only once) for CR kind named Database
- version: v1alpha1
  group: db.example.com
  kind: Database
  playbook: /opt/ansible/db.yml
  reconcilePeriod: 0
  manageStatus: false
----


=== Planning the Reconciliation Loop

In this example, the reconciliation logic for the memcached operator will execute for each Custom Resource with a kind set to `Memcached`.

The logic executed will include the following tasks:

* Create a Deployment for memcached if it doesn't exist
* Check that the Deployment size is set according to the `Memcached` Custom Resource

With these execution steps determined, we can continue with defining the Ansible Operator.


=== Defining Watches.yaml

The Operator SDK has already generated a `watches.yaml` file for the memcached operator that executes an Ansible role named `memcached`:

----
---
- version: v1alpha1
  group: cache.example.com
  kind: Memcached
  role: /opt/ansible/roles/memcached
----


=== Defining the Custom Resource Spec

The next step is to modify the Ansible role that was generated at `roles/memcached` in the project directory.
This role will get executed as part of the Operator's reconciliation loop, and thus is where the logic gets defined.

To define the CR spec (which is done entirely in Ansible), you must populate the default variables file within the role.
This is done so that our operator's spec variables will have default values, in case a user doesn't set the `spec` field of the CR (meaning no variables would get passed to Ansible as `--extra-vars`).
The operator passes all key/value pairs within the CR `spec` field to Ansible as variables (`--extra-vars`).

NOTE: The operator will convert spec field names from camelCase to snake_case before passing them to Ansible. 

Set a default value for the `size` field of the CR spec by editing `roles/memcached/defaults/main.yaml`:

 size: 1


=== Defining the Reconciliation Logic

With the spec defined, we can move on to defining the tasks that Ansible executes when a resource changes.
The default behavior for an Ansible Role is to run the tasks listed in `<role>/tasks/main.yml`.
As determined previously, Ansible will create a Deployment for memcached if it doesn't already exist.
We will use the `k8s` module for Ansible which will allow us to define the Deployment (or any K8s resource) in an Ansible task.

Edit `roles/memcached/tasks/main.yml` as follows:

----
---
- name: start memcached
  k8s:
    definition:
      kind: Deployment
      apiVersion: apps/v1
      metadata:
        name: '{{ meta.name }}-memcached'
        namespace: '{{ meta.namespace }}'
      spec:
        replicas: "{{size}}"
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: memcached
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: memcached
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: memcached
              command:
              - memcached
              - -m=64
              - -o
              - modern
              - -v
              image: "docker.io/memcached:1.4.36-alpine"
              ports:
                - containerPort: 11211
----

NOTE: Notice how we used the `size` variable to populate the value of the `replicas` field in the Deployment.
This allows the user to declare how many memcached replicas are desired by creating a Custom Resource that overrides the default `size` of `1`.


=== Build the Operator Image

Note that you may need to run the build either as root (or use sudo) or as a member of the `docker` group.
You'll also need to substitute `<username>` with that of your quay.io account.

Build the operator container image (this will also tag the image locally):

 $ operator-sdk build quay.io/<username>/memcached-operator:v0.0.1

Once the image is built, push the image to the remote docker registry:

 $ docker push quay.io/<username>/memcached-operator:v0.0.1


=== Edit the Operator Deployment

You must manually add your image to the operator's deployment.

Run the following sed command to inject your operator image into the file, substituting your quay.io `<username>`:

 $ sed -i deploy/operator.yaml \
-e 's|{{ REPLACE_IMAGE }}|quay.io/<username>/memcached-operator:v0.0.1|g'

You must also fix the jinja2 filter populating the `imagePullPolicy` field:

 $ sed -i deploy/operator.yaml -e 's|{{ pull_policy.* }}|Always|g'


=== Deploy the Operator

The K8s manifests for deployment were created in `deploy/`.

Before deploying the operator, first you must load the Custom Resource Description (CRD) for memcached:

 $ oc create -f deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_crd.yaml

Finally, create a new namespace and deploy the memcached operator:

 $ oc new-project memcached-operator
 $ oc create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
 $ oc create -f deploy/role.yaml 
 $ oc create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
 $ oc create -f deploy/operator.yaml


=== Validate the Operator Deployment

The operator is running as a Deployment in the K8s cluster.

To check that the deployment was created:

 $ oc get deployment
 NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
 memcached-operator       1         1         1            1           1m

To check that the operator pod is running:

 $ oc get pods
 NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
 memcached-operator-7cc7cfdf86-vvjqk   1/1       Running   0          1m


=== Create a Custom Resource

To test the operator's functionality, use the Custom Resource provided in `deploy/crds/`.

You can preview the CR contents prior to deploying:

 $ cat deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml
 apiVersion: "cache.example.com/v1alpha1"
 kind: "Memcached"
 metadata:
   name: "example-memcached"
 spec:
   size: 3

Deploy the CR using `oc` or `kubectl`:

 $ oc apply -f deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml


=== Check the Memcached Resources

The operator should have created a deployment for memcached:

 $ oc get deployment
 NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
 memcached-operator       1         1         1            1           2m
 example-memcached        3         3         3            3           1m

There should also be 3 memcached pod replicas:

 $ oc get pods
 NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
 example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-7dqdr     1/1       Running   0          1m
 example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-g5k7v     1/1       Running   0          1m
 example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-m7vn7     1/1       Running   0          1m
 memcached-operator-7cc7cfdf86-vvjqk   1/1       Running   0          2m
 

=== Change the Custom Resource Size

You can get the operator to change the cluster size by updating the CR.

Change the `spec.size` field of the memcached CR from 3 to 4:

 $ sed -i deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml -e 's/3/4/'

Verify that the `sed` command updated the CR:

 $ cat deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml
 apiVersion: "cache.example.com/v1alpha1"
 kind: "Memcached"
 metadata:
   name: "example-memcached"
 spec:
   size: 4


=== Trigger the Operator

With the CR updated, apply the change:

 $ oc apply -f deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_cr.yaml

You should now see 4 memcached pod replicas:

 $ oc get pods
  NAME                                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-7dqdr     1/1       Running   0          2m
  example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-g5k7v     1/1       Running   0          2m
  example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-m7vn7     1/1       Running   0          2m
  example-memcached-6fd7c98d8-4ir9p     1/1       Running   0          1m
  memcached-operator-7cc7cfdf86-vvjqk   1/1       Running   0          3m


=== Clean Up Everything

Cleanup the created resources by deleting the memcached-operator project:

 $ oc delete project memcached-operator

Also, don't forget to remove the Memcached CRD from the cluster:

 $ oc delete -f deploy/crds/cache_v1alpha1_memcached_crd.yaml
