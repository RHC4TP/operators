== Minishift Quick Start Guide
Minishift v1.32 is built using OKD 3.11

The https://connect.redhat.com[Red Hat Connect for Technology Partners] team suggests using minishift for operator development and testing purposes.

Other platforms can be used if desired, such as:

* https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform/[OpenShift Container Platform]
* https://okd.io[OKD (formerly OpenShift Origin)]
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/download/[Container Development Kit] 
* https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube[Minikube]
* `oc cluster up` (requires docker and the https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/[OpenShift Client])

Currently, Minishift is the easiest way to get a minimal OpenShift cluster up and running in the least amount of time.

=== Setup the Virtualization Environment
Install the `docker-machine-kvm` driver (minishift is tested against version 0.10.0):

----
# curl -L https://github.com/dhiltgen/docker-machine-kvm/releases/download/v0.10.0/docker-machine-driver-kvm-centos7 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-kvm
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-kvm
----

Install `libvirt` and `qemu-kvm`:

 # yum install libvirt qemu-kvm

Add yourself to the `libvirt` group:

 # usermod -a -G libvirt <username>

Update your active session to apply the group membership change:

 $ newgrp libvirt

Start/enable the `libvirtd` service:

----
# systemctl start libvirtd
# systemctl enable libvirtd
----

=== Download and Install Minishift
Download the archive for your operating system from the https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases[Minishift Releases] page:

 $ curl -LO https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases/download/v1.32.0/minishift-1.32.0-linux-amd64.tgz

Extract the minishift archive into your preferred location (eg: `$HOME/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`):

 # tar -xzvf minishift-1.32.0-linux-amd64.tgz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin */minishift

Add the `minishift` binary to your `PATH` environment variable (not necessary if using one of the above suggested locations).

=== Launch Minishift
Run the `minishift start` command, which will run `minishift` with the default VM settings:

----
$ minishift start
-- Starting profile 'minishift'
...
-- Minishift VM will be configured with ...
   Memory:    4 GB
   vCPUs :    2
   Disk size: 20 GB
-- Starting Minishift VM .......................... OK
...
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.42.60:8443

You are logged in as:
    User:     developer
    Password: <any value>

To login as administrator:
    oc login -u system:admin
----

=== Enable the OpenShift Client and Kubectl:

The `minishift oc-env` command prints the absolute path of Minishift's `oc` binary. You can embed this command in an `eval` statement which will update your shell's `$PATH` environment variable to include the path to the `oc` binary:

 $ eval $(minishift oc-env)

Test the `oc` command:

 $ oc version

You can enable the `oc` binary system wide by running the following command (you must run the previous command first):

 $ sudo cp $(which oc) /usr/local/bin/

Use a symbolic link to the `oc` binary which will cause it to double as the `kubectl` command:

 # ln -s /usr/local/bin/{oc,kubectl}

NOTE: You'll need root permissions to create the symlink in `/usr/local/bin`

Test the `kubectl` command:

 $ kubectl version
